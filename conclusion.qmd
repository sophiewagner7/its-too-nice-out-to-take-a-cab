# Conclusion

we set out to define what "nice" is in the context of it being too nice out to take a cab.

we assumed a relationship between the weather and taxi usage

first, the pandemic ruined half of our data

it was very hard to develop a "normal" taxi day or hour against which we could compare, because the weather seasonal, and taxis are hebdomadal.

We tried to limit variability, and that was somewhat promising, but the effects we noticed were faint. Future work would test the effects against a null hypothesis.

we tried to relativize, but the results were confusing. 

What we learned without a doubt is that if there is a relaitonship to taxi use and temperature, it is not linear, and there is a sweet spot at around 20Â°, when it is nice enough to walk instead of ride for a short trip, but not so hot to be annoying.

We also learned that rain and cloud cover have small effects on short trip likelihood.

Future steps:

Were we to continue...

not assume independence of weather variables
model the data instead of relying purely on EDA.
use different bins for trip distances to account for the number of trips between one and two miles.
Have more calendar data. would've been great if we had five years. OR control for the pandemic.:w
