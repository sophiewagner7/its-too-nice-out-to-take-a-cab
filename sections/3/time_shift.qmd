## Comparing Different Times to Gauge Behavior Change

The patterns of taxi usage complicate how we can try to analyze weather effects. 
That is, the strong weekly cycle of increasing ridership as the week goes on
contrasts with the relative sense of a “nice” day. 
If we typically take a cab on Friday, 
but elect not to on a specific Friday because the weather is nice,
we are not probably comparing that Friday’s weather to the previous Friday’s.
Instead, we are likely comparing to yesterday’s weather or even this 
morning’s weather.

This means that while taxi ridership has to be compared against 
data from a week previous, 
weather data has to be compared against data from a day previous.
