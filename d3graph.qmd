# Interactive graph

In this section, we carry over our efforts to relativize the relationship 
between changes in temperature from 24 hours earlier and changes in taxi 
ridership from a week ago. 
Instead of presenting all of the data at once, however, we let the user target
a specific temperature and see how ridership differs when the  previous day 
was warmer or colder and by how much. The farther right along the $x$ axis, 
the warmer “today” was than “yesterday.” The farther up the $y$ axis,
the more taxi trips taken “today” compared to “last week.”

We have limited ourselves, as in the previous section, to post-Pandemic, rush
hour traffic when the temperature was -5°-30°.
