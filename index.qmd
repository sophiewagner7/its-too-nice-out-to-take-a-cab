At first, Moacir was interested in seeing if there is a relationship
between “unseasonably” warm weather and New York and drought like
conditions, but Sophie suggested crossing in a dataset from a different
domain and seeing what kinds of results could emerge. After a bit of
discussion, we had a preliminary idea of testing the hypothesis that people
use cabs less often when it is “nice” out in Manhattan. That is, they are
more inclined to walk to their destination than hail an expensive cab.

Quickly it was clear, however, that proving this hypothesis would require
coming up with a definition of “nice,” so we flipped the project: we're
assuming as true that people are more inclined to walk when the weather is
nice, so we are using the taxi data to see if we can define what “nice”
weather is. Does it just mean sunny? Does it have a relationship to an
absolute or relative temperature, such as it being much warmer than earlier
in the day or the day before? And does the effect wear off if there are
multiple nice days in a row, and the novelty of walking gives way to taking
cabs again? These questions struck us as more amusing and speculative, so
we decided to pursue them, instead.
