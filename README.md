We'll get back to you with a description shortly!


On nice days:

- do people only take long cab rides
- are cabs faster (read: fewer cars on the street)
- no change in airport taxis
- only notable during the day time.
- is there a temperature cutoff that triggers this behavior
- is it seasonal.
- does the behavior depend on how long it has been since a rainy day.
- Does filtering by manhattan-to-manhattan trips change the pattern any? (or intra-borough)

Definitions:

- Nice day
- rainy day
